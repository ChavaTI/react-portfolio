        I'm Salvador, I'm a web developer. I fell in love with Informatic topics
        when I wrote my first "Hello World" in C language. That happened when I
        was only a child and since then I've been in love with computer science.
        I studied a engineering degree in Computer Systems and I love to use my
        knowledge to create either web systems, informatic solutions and web
        pages. <br /> <br />
        I'm a geek guy, I love to play with my linux system, learn new stuff, go
        to the movies, read about philosophy, play classNameic video games, play
        the gitar and do exercise.
